Please check if you downloaded the SpigotInstaller.exe from KastenKlicker. You can his name on Github and spigotmc.org.
When you execute the InstallSpigot.exe a Windows SmartScreen window will show up, because I didn't pay 400â‚¬ for a Microsoft certificate.
To start the Installation click on "More info" and "Run away".
Windows Defender will check the SpigotInstaller.exe, in this few seconds your system might freeze or run slow.
Installing and Starting will take a moment.

Please check you downloaded the SpigotInstaller.exe from KastenKlicker. You can find the name on Github and spigotmc.org.
When you execute the InstallSpigot.exe a Windows SmartScreen window will show up, because I don't pay 400â‚¬ for a Microsoft certificate.
To start the Installation click on "More info" and "Run anyway".
Windows Defender will check the SpigotInstaller.exe, in this few seconds your system might freeze or run slow.

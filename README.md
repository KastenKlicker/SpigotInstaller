# SpigotInstaller
Spigot Installer Repository 3.0

This is the repo for a GUI Installer for Spigot.

Feel free to edit and fork the project, but please don't do anything "bad".

When you execute the InstallSpigot.exe a Windows SmartScreen window will show up, because I don't pay 400â‚¬ for a Microsoft certificate.
To start the Installation click on "More info" and "Run anyway".
Windows Defender will check the SpigotInstaller.exe, in this few seconds your system might freeze or run slow.

Dependencies:
INetC https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Inetc_plug-in
